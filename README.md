# e-commerce-backend
Eleventh bootcamp challenge using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research
(YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make a backend for an e-commerce site. When you add the DB name, SQL password, and user 
to a .env file, you can connect to the database via sequelize. When you enter the schema and seed commands, the database is created
and seeded with the proper information. When you launch via "npm start", the server is started and the sequelize models are synced to the
database. When you open the API routes for categories, products, and tags, the test data is displayed in formatted JSON. When you test
the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, you can successfully create, update, and delete data in the DB.
